    <h1>Project 0: Becoming Friends With My Camera</h1>
    <h2>Part 1: Selfie - The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way</h2>
        <div class="part1-img">
            <img src="./media/friend.JPEG">
            <img src="./media/friend2.JPEG">
            <p>Pictures of my friend while studying. Very close up (Left) then 3 feet away with zoom (Right). </p>
            <p>When you take a close-up selfie, the camera exaggerates features that are nearer to the lens and for
                features farther away, they look smaller. So this causes the face to look disproportionate. But in the second
                picture, when we step back, the camera captures the face in the right proportions since from that distance, all
                of the facial features are about the same distance away from the camera. So even if we zoom in, we are keeping the 
                proportionality and uniformness, thus creating a more natural-looking photo.</p>

    <h2>Part 2: Architectural Perspective Compression</h2>
        <div class="part2-img">

            <img src="./media/building2.JPG">
            <p>Picture of Chou Hall first up close (Left), then very far away with zoom (Right). </p>
            <p>Similar to the idea in part 1, when we are far away, the different parts of the building all appear
                the same distance to the camera, making it look more flattened. However, up close, we can capture a 
                more of the depth of the building, which is why it looks like the building is more at an angle in the 
                left picture.</p>

    <h2>Part 3: The Dolly Zoom</h2>
